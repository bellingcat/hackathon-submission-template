# Project name
## OUR PLAN

tool that uses a link of a twitter profile as an input and then scrapes data of two-way interactions between users. 
Tool should also scrape account attributes such as size (how many followers) and for how long they have been on twitter. (Jakob)

This is then converted into a .csv data set which can be used as an edgelist 

This data set is used as an input for an R script that spits out some basic descriptives and visualizations of the network as well as a warning message if the output or input is bullshit

-> make it in a way that people can also only use part of the tool. Like only scraping the data or importing data and only making visualizations. 
-> make the tool modular so different forms of data other than interactions can be added later or more visualizations can be done later
